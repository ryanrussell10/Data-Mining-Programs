# Data-Mining-Programs
Code and experiments relating to various Data Mining and Machine Learning methods explored in UVic SENG 474 (Data Mining).

A1: Python implementation of three Supervised Learning ML methods: a Decision Tree, Random Forest, and Neural Network. Experiments and analysis involving these three ML methods on two binary classification problems.

A2: Implementation of Logistic Regression and Support Vector Machine Supervised Learning ML methods along with implementation of K-Fold Cross-Validation, both in Python. Experiments and analysis of the two ML methods and comparison with and without cross-validation.

A3: Implementation of K-Means Clustering and Hierarchical Agglomerative Clustering Unsupervised Learning ML methods in Python. Experiments and analysis with 2D and 3D data.
